# Project2 Learning From Data


## Description

This project is designed to learn how to train a model from data. We will use the softmax regression, k-Nearest Neighbors and feature selection to train a model. We have three subtasks in this project:

- [Supervised Learning](./src/task1): Softmax Regression to classify the images of given dataset (vectorized, 16x16)
- [Unsupervised Learning](./src/task2): k-Nearest Neighbors to find the most similar images in the given dataset (vectorized, 16x16)
- [Feature Selection](./src/task3): Select the most important features to classify the images of given dataset (vectorized, 16x16)

## Usage

Go to each folder and open with Jupyter Notebook/Lab, VSCode or any other IDE that supports `.ipynb`. And follow instructions in the notebook.
